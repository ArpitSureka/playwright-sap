## [Documentation](https://arpitsureka.github.io/playwright-sap/)

Playwright-SAP is a framework for Web Testing and Automation of SAP Web Applications like Fiori, Netweaver, UI5

There are a lot of issues in using plain-vanilla Playwright on SAP Applications. This node module is built on top of [**Playwright**](https://playwright.dev/) and is built for primarily Testing and Automating SAP Applications.

Since this is built on top of Playwright all the playwright functions and features come with this as well. [Visit this URL for Playwright documentation - https://playwright.dev/](https://playwright.dev/)
