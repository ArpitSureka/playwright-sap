## [Documentation](https://playwright-sap.dev/)

This package contains the no-browser flavor of [Playwright-SAP](https://playwright-sap.dev/).


Playwright-SAP is a framework for Web Testing and Automation of **SAP Web Applications like Fiori, Netweaver, UI5.**

There are a lot of issues in using plain-vanilla Playwright on SAP Web Applications. This node module is built on top of [**Playwright**](https://playwright.dev/) and is built for primarily Testing and Automating SAP Applications.

Since this is **built on top of Playwright** all the playwright functions and features come with this as well.

## Installation

Playwright has its own test runner for end-to-end tests, we call it Playwright Test.

### Using init command

The easiest way to get started with Playwright Test is to run the init command.

```Shell
# Run from your project's root directory
npm init playwright-sap@latest

# Or create a new project
npm init playwright-sap@latest new-project
```

This will create a configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test example.spec.ts. You can now jump directly to writing assertions section.
